#Indentation
''' 
Indentation refers a white spaces at the begining of the code line,
where other programming languages indentation is used for code readability,
but in python indentation refers a block of code
'''
# Example for Indentation 
a = 10
b = 20
if a<b:
	print("a is less than b ")
else:
	print("a is not less than b ")

# how much space you have to give for an indentation?
''' 
As a programmer that is upto you, you can give any number of spaces but
more than one, and you have to give same number of spaces within the block 
otherwise python will throw you an error.
