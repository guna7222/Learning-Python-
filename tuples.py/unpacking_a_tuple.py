when you create a tuple obviously you will assign a value to it, so this is called packing

# What is unpacking?

When you have a sequence of collection in a list, tuple or etc.,
python allows you to extract the value into variables.

#Example for unpacking

x = ('tuple', 'list', 'dict')
a, b, c = x #xtract the value into variables.
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
